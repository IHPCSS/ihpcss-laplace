To clarify: our wish is that you should be able to use this code in any way
you want as a template or inspiration for your own project. If you fork it
to produce modified software engineering tutorial it would be nice if you
leave the IHPCSS credits, but if you just want to borrow the organization,
software engineering setup and CMake configuration files, there is no need
to include any copyright notices whatsoever in your binaries or source code,
although we always appreciate to know if somebody found it useful!

One caveat: A couple of the modules in the 'cmake' subdirectory are from
the CMake distribution, and as such BSD-licensed. If that is a concern, you
can always move those modules to a separate location on your workstation
(outside of your source tree).
