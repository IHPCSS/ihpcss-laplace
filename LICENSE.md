A few of the modules in the cmake directory are taken from newer versions of
CMake, and distributed under the BSD 3-clause license as specified in those files.

Another few of the cmake modules were adapted from GROMACS by Erik Lindahl,
but just as the rest of the cmake code they are made available under the more
permissible BSD 3-clause license here (rather than the usual GROMACS license).
